# Bitcoin Price Application (for the Web)

This is a web application, written in JavaScript and with Node.js, where you can see a simple text with the current price of Bitcoin. 

This project will serve as a template for future projects.

My main purpose for creating this project is to learn more about JavaScript and about Node.js.
